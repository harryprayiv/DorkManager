[![Haskell CI using Nix Flake](https://github.com/cardanonix/pelotero-engine/actions/workflows/haskell.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/cardanonix/pelotero-engine/actions/workflows/haskell.yml)

Currently, this project scans all of the folders listed in the config.txt file (which is just directories seperated by a line break) and creates a delimited json file with each movie in it's own json object on each new line.  It helps me to keep track of my whole library and also to find nfo files that are incorrectly formatted inside of my vast movie library.  I plan to expand this to keep track of my library with postgreSQL once I get the basic functionality prototyped with simple json objects.
